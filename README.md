Theme:
Out of Control

Ideas:
Subway surfer type game? Always running forward. Can't stop moving.
* You place items that move the character instead of direct control
* Limited resource: must reach the end of the level, so it becomes a puzzle.

QWAP-like game? Very difficult to control the character.
* More examples: Getting Over It, Pogo stuck

Power fantasy? Like having access to all the high level spells and no mana cost.
* Balance between getting more powerful but losing control over that power.
** Like Vampire Survivors? But you have to also save civilians, and your powerful attacks can hurt them.
** Friendly fire as a core mechanic for balance.
* Maybe one attack fires off a 2nd, random attack that you can't control.
* Maybe random primary attacks in general?
* What if you remove the ability for the player to move? They just plan out a turn.
* Dole out accuracy to specific attacks?

An Auto-chess-like game. You set up state, but then the game "plays out" by itself without player control.
* You control the environment instead of the main character?
* Planning for multiple characters in the level?
* Control as a resource that the player must spend (like a stamina bar)

Drafting out a game:
Level-based or wave-based?
Wave-based:
* Use the control currency to take control of the character, otherwise they move randomly
* Take control to make sure they don't damage the town or the citizens
* See the planned queue of actions, use control to overwrite it
* Theme: loose cannon cop that is out of control, and you are his assistant, you spend influence to reign him in.
* If you overspend the currency the loose-canon throws a tantrum and wrecks things.
Level-based:
* ADHD simulator: you are the emotions in someone's head. Mission: due laundry. Try to make the character avoid distractions. Represent them as expanding spheres?
Mix the two?
* The map might stay the same, but each Wave is a Level, and you can receive information about the next wave that changes what you prioritize in between.
